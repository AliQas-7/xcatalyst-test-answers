For real time notification system I would like to use Firebase push notifications. Its fast, realiable, easy to implement and secure.
here are the steps for this:
1. get the firebase configuration file.
2. authorize the firebase using that file.
3. Enable the notification api from firebase web panel.
4. use the api to send the push notifications. 

other aproach is to use web sockets which are better options too for real time notifications.

other option also includes expo push notifications. use expo sdk to send notifications.
1. just get the device push token and send it to the expo api and setup the api to send the custom notifications.
