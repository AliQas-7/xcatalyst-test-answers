Caching:
Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory. This reduces the need to query the database repeatedly for the same data.
You can use caching solutions like Redis or Memcached.

Database Query Optimization:

Ensure that your database queries are optimized by using appropriate indexes and projections.
Avoid fetching unnecessary fields and use pagination to limit the number of records retrieved.
